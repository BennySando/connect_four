# connect_four
A simple connect 4 game I whipped up to practice coding in C++. Actually my first project in C++. Takes advantage of the object-oriented nature of C++ as well as some of its more unique features, such as vectors and reference parameters. In the project itself, you can either play with 2 people, or you could play against an AI (or watch two AIs play against each other). The AI itself is quite simple and could use some refined planning algorithms, but it's my first attempt at an AI and it still plays optimally given the current state of the board. It just canlt plan very far ahead beyond that. The AI itself also has 5 difficulty settings, with 1 being the easiest and 5 being the hardest. 5 is the closest to an actual human oppponent, as well.
